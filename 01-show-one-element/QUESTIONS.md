# DOM Atomic 01: Show One Element

## Questions

---

> If you click the link to reveal more text and then refresh the page, does the text remain revealed, or is it hidden again? Why?

Your reply here... It is hidden again because when you refresh the page it sets the page to default.

---

> Remove `window.addEventListener("load", function(){` (and the closing `})`) from **global.js**. Does the link still reveal the text? What is the purpose of this code that you've removed?

Your reply here... No it doesnt reveal the text because you deleate the line that defines the whole function.

> Describe the the `addEventListener` method. (Remember that there is a specific, technical, methodical way to describe methods. Your reply should match that format.)

Your reply here... The addEventListener method attaches an event handler to the specified element.
